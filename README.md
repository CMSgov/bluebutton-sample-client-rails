Blue Button Sample Client Application - Rails Version
======================================================

## Introduction

This client demonstrates authenticating to the Blue Buttom API and subsequent FHIR API calls.
It demonstrates the OAuth2 Server Side web application flow where a `client_secret` is used.

This client is built using the Ruby on Rails web application framework. 

The 'oauth2' Ruby Gem is used for OAuth 2.0 client functions.

Docker is used to containerize (or virtualize) the Rails web application server.

## Status and Contributing

The application is in active development so check back often for updates.
Please consider improving this code with your contributions. Pull requests welcome ;)
